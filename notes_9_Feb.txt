# Réunion 9 Février:

- Scheduler modified to multi-step to reduce LR more rapidly
- In DEBUG logs, curves have different BATCH_SIZE so they don't last all the same number of steps

## How to see if it worked?
- See if centroids of lowres and highres are separable (LDA) (ideally: no)
- What is specifically Top1 and Top5?
- Testing inference mode: Does highres->36x36->prediction (lowres_32) works the same as highres->prediction (lowres_144)?

## Finetuning
- Keep head from training, freeze backbone
- Explore only head finetuning vs. feature concatenation
